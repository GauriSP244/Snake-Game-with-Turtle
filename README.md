A classic **Snake Game** implemented in Python using the **Turtle Graphics** module. This project is a simple yet fun game where players control a snake to collect food and grow in length while avoiding collisions with walls or itself.

## Features

- Classic Snake Game mechanics
- The snake grows as it eats food
- Tracks the player’s score
- Game-over screen when the snake collides with itself or the wall
- Simple and visually appealing design

## Demo

Here's a quick visual of the game:

- **Start Screen**: Displays an empty screen with the snake ready to move.
- **Gameplay**: The snake moves in the specified direction, eats food, and grows in length.
- **Game Over**: Shows a "Game Over" message when the snake collides with the wall or itself.
